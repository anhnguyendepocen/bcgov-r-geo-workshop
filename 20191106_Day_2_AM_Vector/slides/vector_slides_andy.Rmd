Spatial data divided into two categories: Vector and Raster

- vector data represents the world using points, lines and polygons. 
- discrete, well-defined borders, meaning that vector data usually have a high level of precision

- raster data divides the surface up into cells of constant size. 
- basis of background images used in web-mapping 
- aerial photography and satellite-based remote sensing devices. 
- Rasters aggregate spatially specific features to a given resolution, meaning that they are consistent over space and scalable.

- Simple Features is a standard specification (Open Geospatial Consortium) - 
agreed-upon way to represent vector spatial data
- represent all common vector geometry types : points, lines, polygons and their respective ‘multi’ versions 
- supports geometry collections, which can contain multiple geometry types in a single object. 
- sf supersedes the sp ecosystem, which comprises sp , rgdal for data read/write  and rgeos for spatial operations.

## Reading spatial data

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(sf)
```


```{r}
airports <- st_read("data/20191106_Day_2_AM_Vector/bc_airports.gpkg", quiet = TRUE)
airports
```

???

go through sf header info:
- size (# of features and # of columns/attributes)
- geometry type
- dimension (XY - can have Z and M)
- bbox
- epsg
- proj4

---

# Key features of an `sf` object

```{r message=TRUE}

st_geometry(airports)

st_bbox(airports)

st_crs(airports)
```

---

# An `sf` object is a `data.frame`

```{r}
class(airports)
is.data.frame(airports)
summary(airports)

```

---

## We can turn it into a normal `data.frame`

```{r}
airports_df <- st_drop_geometry(airports)
head(airports_df)
```

---

## Coordinate Reference Systems
.pull-left[
### Geographic
- spherical or ellipsoidal surface; ellipsoid defined by the _datum_
- lat/long, measured in angular distances (degrees/radians)

<center><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Azimutalprojektion-schief_kl.jpg" alt="geocrs" /></center>
]

.pull-right[
### Projected
- Cartesian coordinates on a flat plane
- origin, x and y axes, linear unit of measurement (e.g., m)

defines how the spatial elements of the data relate to the surface of the Earth

Geographic: 
- identify any location on the Earth’s surface using two values — longitude and latitude. 
- Longitude is location in the East-West direction in angular distance from the Prime Meridian plane. 
- Latitude is angular distance North or South of the equatorial plane. 
- Distances in geographic CRSs are therefore not measured in meters. This has important consequences

Projected:
- based on a geographic CRS
- rely on map projections to convert the three-dimensional surface of the Earth into Easting and Northing (x and y) values in a projected CRS
- often named based on a property they preserve: equal-area preserves area, azimuthal preserve direction, equidistant preserve distance, and conformal preserve local shape.
- conic, cylindrical, planar
